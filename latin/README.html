        <h2>
          The Clementine Vulgate: plain text
        </h2>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This page is for those who want to convert the <a href="http://vulsearch.sourceforge.net/">text of the Clementine
          Vulgate</a> into a format of their choosing.
	</p>

	<h3>Description of the markup</h3>
	<p>The text is plain text, codepage 1252, with DOS-style line endings.
	Commas and periods have no space before, and a single space after
	(unless they end a line&mdash;there is never a space at the end of a
	verse), whereas <code>: ; ? !</code> each have a single space before, and a single
	space after (unless they end a line). In general, the first word of a
	verse is not capitalized, nor the first word of a line of poetry, but
	the first word of a sentence, as well as the first word of direct speech
	or quotation, is capitalized.</p>

	<p>The text really has two structures: the traditional division
	into books, chapters and verses, and a 'natural' structure as sentences
	and paragraphs. This latter structure is not an intrinsic part of the
	text, and has been imposed differently by each editor of the Vulgate
	through the centuries; for my part I have tried to use punctuation both
	to make the meaning transparent, and to reflect the natural
	cadences in the text.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Paragraph divisions are indicated by a backslash <code>\</code>, though this is
	  omitted at the very start or end of a chapter. This is followed by a
	  space if it should occur in the middle of a verse.</li>
	  <li>When text is set as verse, the start and end of a section of verse are
	  indicated by brackets <code>[</code> (preceded by a space) and
	  <code>]</code> (followed by a space unless it end
	  the verse) respectively. Line breaks within the verse are indicated by
	  a slash <code>/</code> (followed by a space unless it end the verse).</li>
	  <li>When different speakers are indicated (e.g.&nbsp;in the
	  Lamentations), the speaker's name is placed between angle brackets
	  <code>&lt;&hellip;&gt;</code>, with no space after the closing bracket.</li>
	  <li>Lamentations and Ecclesiasticus have prologues (which I believe
	  are non-canonical?). In the source,
	  this appears at the start of 1:1, though logically it belongs before
	  the start of ch.&nbsp;1. The prologue is preceded by
	  <code>&lt;Prologus&gt;</code> and in both books the text of
	  verse&nbsp;1 begins at the first bracket <code>[</code>.</li>
	  <li>Information on the creators and proof-readers of each book can be
	  found in <code>source/data.txt</code>; a description of the format of
	  this file appears at its head.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Example script: makehtml.sed</h3>
	<p>This is a sed script that does the meat of the work: it converts the
	  source files to the body of a valid XHTML document. It should be an
	  easy matter to modify this script to produce XML with whatever tags
	  you want.
          </p>
